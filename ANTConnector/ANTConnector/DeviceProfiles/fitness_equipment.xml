		The fitness equipment has a relatively small pairing zone, marked by
		the “Link Here” logo. A user begins a fitness session by approaching
		the fitness equipment and entering the pairing zone. If the user is 
		wearing a watch, pairing between the watch and equipment will occur 
		when the user places their watch within close proximity to the “Link
		Here” logo. Once pairing has been established, the range of 
		communication between the watch and FE moves from the pairing zone 
		to the tracking zone. The watch may wirelessly transfer user 
		information and a workout or course file using ANT File Share 
		(ANT-FS) technology and the Flexible and Interoperable Data Transfer
		(FIT) protocol. The fitness equipment will then begin broadcasting 
		real time workout data which may also include events such as workout
		starts and stops, as well as lap events. The watch displays and
		records data, and responds to any events (i.e. starting/stopping
		chronometer and recording lap events).
