#ANT+ Connector

Connect to ANT+ devices from within Mathematica using this mathematica library. There are
instructions for connecting devices in the sample notebook. Not all ANT+ device
profiles are supported right now, but many are. For profiles that are not
supported, a framework exists within the library for writing custom connections.

Feedback welcome!
